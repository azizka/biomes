# Print metadata for selected biome definitions

Prints a human-readable summary of the biome classifications shipped
with the package. For each requested classification the function prints
the publication, the criteria and methodology used to define the
classes, a short description, the number of classes, the raster layer
index, and a list of biome names with their raster values.

## Usage

``` r
biomes_info(x = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Integer vector of layer indices between 1 and 31. If `NULL` (the
  default), information for all 31 classifications is printed.

## Value

Invisibly returns the integer vector of layer indices that was printed.
The function is called for its side effect of printing to the console.

## Details

This is the *interactive* sibling of the `biomes_information` data set:
use
[`biomes_information`](https://azizka.github.io/biomes/reference/biomes_information.md)
when you want the raw metadata table (e.g. to subset, filter, or join
programmatically), and `biomes_info()` when you want a quick read of the
most relevant fields for a specific layer.

## See also

[`biomes_information`](https://azizka.github.io/biomes/reference/biomes_information.md)
for the underlying metadata table and
[`biomes_legend`](https://azizka.github.io/biomes/reference/biomes_legend.md)
for the mapping from raster values to biome names.

#> 
#> Layer in raster stack: 29
#> 
#> Criteria: Climate (temperature, potential evapotranspiration), potential natural vegetation, soil, topography, elevation
#> 
#> Methodology: Biogeographic analysis
#> 
#> Description: An underlying assumption of the Atlas of Biogeography is that vegetation patterns mirror climatic conditions and are furthermore influenced by regional geological effects and disturbances. Geographical units are defined by zonal natural vegetation with climax stages that cannot be distinguishing by sharp gradients. Anthropogenic effects are not considered in this theoretical concept. The map was adapted by Sitte et al. (2002) and by Pfadenhauer & Klötzli (2014). “Atlas of Biogeography” is the translated title. The original title is “Atlas zur Biogeographie” (German).

#> 
#> Layer in raster stack: 31
#> 
#> Criteria: Bio-physical environmental parameters including temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, soil characteristics, flora and fauna, continentality and maritime influence, snow cover
#> 
#> Methodology: Classification according to defined thresholds on climatic data, vegetation proxies and surface cover indices
#> 
#> Description: For this classification, biomes are defined as consistent terrestrial ecological regions to form habitats which correspond to relatively uniform landscapes. Those fundamental global ecological units are characterized by similar vegetation and fauna. Important shaping factors are climate and soil. The concept includes ecotones which mark small-scale transition zones between distinct areas of certain exclusive classes. Zonobiomes are zonally connected and azonal relief units, like mountain systems, are defined as orobiomes.  The first version consisted of two volumes with the original title “Die Vegetation der Erde in öko-physiologischer Betrachtung“ (Walter, 1964, 1968). There have been several later English and German editions of this fundamental book series over the past decades. Those include among others Walter (1973, 1979, 1984, 1990) and Walter & Breckle (1985, 1991, 1999). The map consulted in this inventory was taken from the last edition by Breckle & Rafiqpoor (2019).

#> Description: Global biomes were simulated over the past 140,000 years. Input factors to the dynamic global vegetation model included reconstructed atmospheric CO2 concentrations, Earth's obliquity and paleo- as well as pre-industrial climate simulations by HadCM3. Biomes were assigned according to specified ranges of vegetation carbon mass and leaf area index (LAI) of functional plant types based on consistent rules.
